ruby-libvirt (0.6.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Antonio Terceiro ]
  * debian/rules: remove manual test run in favor of gem2deb's own mechanism
    for running tests, avoiding building the C extension twice on every Debian
    build.
    * This also gives us autopkgtest support almost for free; so add
      `Testsuite: autopkgtest` in debian/control
  * debian/rules: call debian/gemspec.rake to build a gemspec during the build
    (Closes: #795603)

ruby-libvirt (0.5.1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * [a629df2] Set safer env vars.  We can't expect to have a $HOME and we don'
    want to default to anything than the test driver.

ruby-libvirt (0.5.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * [0852a9a] Fix a crash in vir*List* wrappers
  * [e097992] Run some tests during build. Making all tests usable with the
    testdriver will require some more work.

ruby-libvirt (0.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Christian Hofstaedtler ]
  * [b394165] Remove legacy transitional packages.
    The upgrade path is given because the transitional packages have been
    part of wheezy already. Also, the 1.8 package would mean that we need
    to keep Ruby 1.8 around.
  * [3a4994f] Build-Depend on ruby2.0-supporting gem2deb.
    Packages built with gem2deb >= 0.6 will build for Ruby 1.9.1 and
    Ruby 2.0, but not Ruby 1.8.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * [798935f] New upstream version 0.5.1 (Closes: #733413)
