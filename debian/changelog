ruby-libvirt (0.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Christian Hofstaedtler ]
  * [b394165] Remove legacy transitional packages.
    The upgrade path is given because the transitional packages have been
    part of wheezy already. Also, the 1.8 package would mean that we need
    to keep Ruby 1.8 around.
  * [3a4994f] Build-Depend on ruby2.0-supporting gem2deb.
    Packages built with gem2deb >= 0.6 will build for Ruby 1.9.1 and
    Ruby 2.0, but not Ruby 1.8.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * [798935f] New upstream version 0.5.1 (Closes: #733413)
